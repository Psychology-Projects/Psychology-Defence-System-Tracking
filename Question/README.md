I am working on projecting the psychological defense system to a brain functional map and asked one question here. So, as you can see I have connected some defense mechanism to brain map functions, as shown below (link 1 and 2):

The reason behind this work is for:

Suggesting new neurofeedback methods based of achieved functional map for improving the Specific defense mechanism based of engineering artificial Neural Network theories (like hopfield Networks) and Logic (like fuzzy rules) as shown below:(LINKS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

So I asked here to get some comment or answer for finding some paper or popular tag for searching the information about this field.

If it needs more work or information, I could give my Skype like here too.

Thanks.
